## Style Guidelines:

- Overall color scheme: A modern, sleek dark mode for focused coding.
- Primary color: A vibrant, clear blue (#4DA7F7) to highlight interactive elements and provide a sense of technical precision.
- Background color: A very dark, subtle blue-gray (#15191C) as the primary canvas for code and interface elements.
- Accent color: A soft, light cyan (#85D4EC) used sparingly for key information, alerts, or to draw attention to new content.
- UI elements and body text: 'Inter', a neutral and highly legible grotesque-style sans-serif font.
- Code display: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced sans-serif font optimized for readability of code.
- Clean, outlined icons that visually represent file types, folder actions, and AI functionalities without being overly decorative.
- Multi-pane layout with adjustable resizing for the file explorer, code editor, and AI assistant panel, mimicking traditional IDEs.
